# EggsampleCalendarEventsAPI

This project is to demonstrate the usage of CalendarEventsAPI. It is a functioning Bukkit plugin that has [CalendarEvents] as a dependency and will register a Calendar event to get called 2 minutes after server start and on two other hardcoded timings.

As an example of how to listen for a CalendarEvent, a message will be printed to the console from a listener when the custom event is called.
