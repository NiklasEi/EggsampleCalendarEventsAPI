# CalendarEvents example usage

This project demonstrates the usage of the CalendarEvents API. It is a functioning Bukkit plugin that has [CalendarEvents] as a dependency and registers a calendar event to get called 2 minutes after server start and on two other hardcoded, repeating timings.

As an example of how to listen for a CalendarEvent, a message is printed to the console by a listener when the custom event is called.
